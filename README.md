# webrtc-demo-browser-node-unified

This is a demo WebRTC app that can be deployed to both browser and server.


## Use case

Alice speaks, Bob listens.


## Key libraries

- isomorphic-webrtc
- node-webrtc-media-devices
- isomorphic-audio-player


## Run and test

You need to plug a ear phone, do not use the public speaker.
Because we run everything on the same laptop, microphone will take speaker output as input, it is an endless loop which will produce lots of noise.
